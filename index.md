# Motivation

Wine is often seen as an important segment of the culinary arts. Wine has existed for centuries, and the way that it has been produced, sourced, and bottled is constantly changing with the adoption of technology in farming. Wine consumption has steadily increased over the past twenty or so years, with the advent of major commercialization and the ‘new world’ joining the ranks of pre-existing major wine producers. Wine has also become a store of value, sometimes with returns even greater than the stock and bond markets. 

The motivation of this analysis is straightforward - we both love red wine and want to spread our love of red wine to our fellow peers. Wine is often seen as an expensive alcohol that requires capital for quality, and we want to prove that this is not the case. Some of the best wines that we have had cost as little as $12, yet, when we conducted some preliminary research for this project, our peers thought that the average price of wine cost around $30. This common misconception prevents college students from consuming wine and enjoying a beverage rich in history. 

Wine plays an important role in many countries, and is becoming increasingly important in American culture. The United States is now the 4th biggest producer of wine, after France, Italy, and Spain. Interestingly, the United States is the biggest consumer of wine, with an increasing number of individuals falling in love with this form of alcohol. We choose to specifically study wine from the US because of its growing demand and appreciation, alongside the fact that we both originally study in the US. We used Vivino, a powerful marketplace to analyze wine and extract our data. Vivino uses crowd-sourced data to personalize wine recommendations to its users, making it the premier platform to search for and buy the right wine. 

# Justification

In popular culture, wine is seen as an alcoholic beverage purchased and consumed for special occasions, at restaurants with family, friends, and business colleagues. Wine can be classified into three major categories - red, white, and rose. Red wine is produced from the grapes and skin of red grapes, white wine is produced with the pulp of white grapes, and rose is produced with a mixture of red and white grapes. Through fermentation and the addition of sugar, raw grapes are processed into a drink that is enjoyed worldwide. 

Since the data set would be too large to take into account all the different styles and types of wine, we decided to focus on red wine production in the US. Red wine is the most popular style of wine, with prices ranging from as little as $2 to over $15,000. This not only makes it exciting to analyze but also provides depth to the data we can extract. Additionally, the different characteristics of wine, along with the sheer variety of styles and grapes within red wine production, make it a topic worth exploring. 


# Aim

To provide an accurate analysis of which ones truly represent value for money from the US region, we needed to probe and ask a specific set of questions. Amongst many of the questions we aimed to answer, a few key thoughts were:

What year of production yields the highest rating of red wine (California and its regions)?
How does price impact red wine ratings in California?
What are the most and least popular red wine grapes grown in California?
What are the best food pairings (vegetarian cuisine, steak) that go well with red wine?

From these main questions, we were able to dive deeper into the data and create sub-questions that really helped us focus on the quality of red wine in California.

#### Understanding the Data

To gain an accurate representation of our data, we had to adjust filters on Vivino to suit the needs of our exploration. We changed the original settings to

As we can see here, we chose to 
Ship to: United States
Region of production: United States
State of production: California
Price range: $0 - $500
Rating: Any (above one star)
